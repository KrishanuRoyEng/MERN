# 🚀 First MERN Project

Welcome to my **first ever MERN project**!  
This project is a starting point to explore and build full-stack applications using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Visual Studio Code (VSC)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

---

## 📦 Installation

1. **Download the Code:**
   - Click the green `Code` button
   - Select **Download ZIP**
   - Extract the ZIP to your desired folder

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Open your terminal in the project folder and run:

   ```bash
